To see the movement on your screen, you will need to do all this steps.
1. load all of this files,I provided to you.
2. extract the .zip file and open up and load the file to the editor you used.(eg. Visual Studio Code)
   Best I recomend to you is to use VScode and load the extension ev3 and follow on the instruction for download micro-pythoin on ev3 mindstrom.
   3. upload the .py script to youur ev3, then once you finsish angle on your ev3 using gyroscope, load the status file from ev3 to computer and openup movement.py file then you're done.
